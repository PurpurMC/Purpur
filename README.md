IdeaJar.

This is a fork on Purpur, and Paper, which is going to aim to be as vanilla as possible while still providing the performance of of Purpur, and Paper.
This server jar will  be able to be used on servers that want the speed of Purpur and Paper, but want to keep the qualities of the vanilla game. This will be ideal for the technical Minecraft community for use on their servers hopefully.

Any help sent for this project will be highly valued.

This jar file will be used on IdeaSpace Anarchy, which you can join from any version from 1.4.7 - 1.16.4. The IP is: ideaspace.apexmc.co.

Please join the Discord channel for this project for help, and to talk about this server.
