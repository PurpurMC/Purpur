Subject: [PATCH] Tuinity Server Changes

Brand changes

MC-Dev fixes

Util patch

Tuinity Server Config

Multi-Threaded Server Ticking Vanilla

This patch is the vanilla server changes

Currently a placeholder patch.

Multi-Threaded ticking CraftBukkit

These are the changes to CB

Currently a placeholder patch.

Add soft async catcher

Must be enabled via -Dtuinity.strict-thread-checks=true

Delay chunk unloads

Chunk unloads are now delayed by 1s. Specifically, ticket level
reduction is delayed by 1s. This is done to allow players to
teleport and have their pets follow them, as the chunks will no longer
unload or have entity ticking status removed.

It's also targetted to reduce performance regressions when
plugins or edge cases in code do not spam sync loads since chunks
without tickets get unloaded immediately.

Configurable under `delay-chunkunloads-by` in config.

This patch replaces the paper patch as the paper patch only
affects player loaded chunks, when we want to target all
loads.

Attempt to recalculate regionfile header if it is corrupt

Instead of trying to relocate the chunk, which is seems to never
be the correct choice, so we end up duplicating or swapping chunks,
we instead drop the current regionfile header and recalculate -
hoping that at least then we don't swap chunks, and maybe recover
them all.

Lag compensate block breaking

Use time instead of ticks if ticks fall behind

Update version fetcher repo

Sets the target github repo to Tuinity in the version checker. Also disables the jenkins build lookups.

Per World Spawn Limits

Detail more information in watchdog dumps

- Dump position, world, velocity, and uuid for currently ticking entities
- Dump player name, player uuid, position, and world for packet handling

Execute chunk tasks mid-tick

This will help the server load chunks if tick times are high.

Change writes to use NORMAL priority rather than LOW

Should limit build up of I/O tasks, or at least properly
indicate to server owners that I/O is falling behind

Allow controlled flushing for network manager

Only make one flush call when emptying the packet queue too

This patch will be used to optimise out flush calls in later
patches.

Consolidate flush calls for entity tracker packets

Most server packets seem to be sent from here, so try to avoid
expensive flush calls from them.

This change was motivated due to local testing:

- My server spawn has 130 cows in it (for testing a prev. patch)
- Try to let 200 players join spawn

Without this change, I could only get 20 players on before they
all started timing out due to the load put on the Netty I/O threads.

With this change I could get all 200 on at 0ms ping.

(one of the primary issues is that my CPU is kinda trash, and having
4 extra threads at 100% is just too much for it).

So in general this patch should reduce Netty I/O thread load.

Time scoreboard search

Plugins leaking scoreboards will make this very expensive,
let server owners debug it easily

Make CallbackExecutor strict again

The correct fix for double scheduling is to avoid it. The reason
this class is used is because double scheduling causes issues
elsewhere, and it acts as an explicit detector of what double
schedules. Effectively, use the callback executor as a tool of
finding issues rather than hiding these issues.

This patch also reverts incorrect use(s) of the class by paper.

- getChunkFutureAsynchronously
  There is no risk at all of recursion. The future is executed on
  the chunk provider's thread queue, the same place general plugin
  load callbacks are executed on. Forcing the task execution into
  the callback executor also prevents the future from catching
  any exception thrown from it.

Optimise entity hard collision checking

Very few entities actually hard collide, so store them in their own
entity slices and provide a special getEntites type call just for them.
This reduces entity collision checking impact (in my testing) by 25%
for crammed entities (shove 130 cows into an 8x6 area in one chunk).
Less crammed entities are likely to show significantly less benefit.
Effectively, this patch optimises crammed entity situations.

Improved oversized chunk data packet handling

Now target all TE data, except for TE's that do not have
update packets.

This patch relies upon the improve extra packet handling
patch, as we now use PacketPlayOutMapChunk as an extra packet.
See its patch notes for further details.

Reduce iterator allocation from chunk gen

Replace via iterating over an array

Prevent long map entry creation in light engine

Use fastiterator to prevent it

Highly optimise single and multi-AABB VoxelShapes and collisions

Reduce allocation rate from crammed entities

Optimise chunk tick iteration

Use a dedicated list of entity ticking chunks to reduce the cost

Use entity ticking chunk map for entity tracker

Should bring us back in-line with tracker performance
before the loaded entity list reversion.

Improve paper prevent moving into unloaded chunk check

Check the AABB of the move

Improve async tp to not load chunks when crossing worlds

Fixes an issue where a getCubes call would load neighbouring chunks.
Loads less chunks than paper's implementation

Revert getChunkAt(Async) retaining chunks for long periods of time

Rework PlayerChunk main thread checks

These need to fail instead of continuing, as hiding these errors
the way paper has is just going to allow unexpected reordering
of callbacks.

For example, thanks to this patch incorrect future
completion (completion of the world gen future,
PlayerChunkMap#b(PlayerChunk, ChunkStatus)) was detected and fixed.

Allow Entities to be removed from a world while ticking

Fixes issues like disconnecting players while ticking them, or
issues where teleporting players across worlds while ticking.

Also allows us to run mid tick while ticking entities.

Prevent unload() calls removing tickets for sync loads

Prevent log spam for "Block is water but TE is chest"

Happens when breaking a waterlogged chest.
Fix is to just not validate the TE while the chest is being removed.

Optimise collision checking in player move packet handling

Don't need to do another getCubes call if the move() call
doesn't find any collisions

Optimise heightmap access

HeightMap uses DataBits for storage to reduce the memory footprint
of the underlying heightmap. However, this reduction in memory
footprint comes at the cost of encoding/decoding each access.

So we can make the tradeoff of raw array access by using a char
array internally. For every 100,000 chunks, this will add approximately
80MB overhead (4 heightmaps per full chunk) - which is acceptable.

Manually inline methods in BlockPosition

Separate lookup locking from state access in UserCache

Prevent lookups from stalling simple state access/write calls

Distance manager tick timings

Recently this has been taking up more time, so add a timings to
really figure out how much.

Name craft scheduler threads according to the plugin using them

Provides quick access to culprits running far more threads than
they should be

Fix swamp hut cat generation deadlock

The worldgen thread will attempt to get structure references
via the world's getChunkAt method, which is fine if the gen is
not cancelled - but if the chunk was unloaded, the call will block
indefinitely. Instead of using the world state, we use the already
supplied generatoraccess which will always have the chunk available.

Range check flag dirty calls in PlayerChunk

Simply return.

Optimise tab complete

Some of the toLowerCase calls can be expensive.

Do not allow ticket level changes while unloading playerchunks

Sync loading the chunk at this stage would cause it to load
older data, as well as screwing our region state.

Make sure inlined getChunkAt has inlined logic for loaded chunks

Tux did some profiling some time ago and showed that the
previous getChunkAt method which had inlined logic for loaded
chunks did get inlined, but the standard CPS.getChunkAt
method was not inlined.

Paper recently reverted this optimisation, so it's been reintroduced
here.

Temporarily Revert usage of Region Manager

Has some stability issues.

Add packet limiter config

Example config:
packet-limiter:
  kick-message: '&cSent too many packets'
  limits:
    all:
      interval: 7.0
      max-packet-rate: 500.0
    PacketPlayInAutoRecipe:
      interval: 4.0
      max-packet-rate: 5.0
      action: DROP

all section refers to all incoming packets, the action for all is
hard coded to KICK.

For specific limits, the section name is the class's name,
and an action can be defined: DROP or KICK

If interval or rate are less-than 0, the limit is ignored

Optimise closest entity lookup used by AI goals

Use a special entity slice for tracking entities by class as well
as counts per chunk. This should reduce the number of entities searched.

Optimise EntityInsentient#checkDespawn

Use a distance map to map out close players.
Note that it's important that we cache the distance map value per chunk
since the penalty of a map lookup could outweigh the benefits of
searching less players (as it basically did in the outside range patch).

Remove streams for villager AI

POI searching:
Turns out chaining a lot of streams together has inane amounts of
overheard. Use the good ol iterator method to remove that overhead.

The rest is just standard stream removal.

Also remove streams for poi searching in some zombie pathfinding.

Don't lookup fluid state when raytracing

Just use the iblockdata already retrieved, removes a getType call.

Reduce pathfinder branches

Reduce static path type detection to simple lazy-init fields

Add Velocity natives for encryption and compression

Optimise non-flush packet sending

Places like entity tracking make heavy use of packet sending,
and internally netty will use some very expensive thread wakeup
calls when scheduling.

Thanks to various hacks in ProtocolLib as well as other
plugins, we cannot simply use a queue of packets to group
send on execute. We have to call execute for each packet.

Tux's suggestion here is exactly what was needed - tag
the Runnable indicating it should not make a wakeup call.

Big thanks to Tux for making this possible as I had given
up on this optimisation before he came along.

Locally this patch drops the entity tracker tick by a full 1.5x.
